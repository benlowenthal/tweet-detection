# tweet-detection
Machine learning solution for detecting the difference between real and fake tweets.

1. Required files
2. Important functions
3. F1 score

==================================

1. REQUIRED FILES

"model.py", "trainset.txt" and "testset.txt" are required, and contain the model and raw data.

"model.pt" stores the model's parameters for further training and inference, and can be generated by training.

"cache.txt" and "testcache.txt" contain the sanitized text, to avoid repeated calls to Google Translate API. They can be generated with TextManipulator class.

"vocab.txt" holds the vocab of the net to ensure the indexes of words are not changed between runs, and can be made from the TextManipulator class.

==================================

2. IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS

train(epochs, warmup) trains the currently loaded neural network for 'epochs' epochs. The optional 'warmup' parameter specifies the number of epochs of learning rate warmup. It produces a graph showing the loss of each epoch over the training period.

test() calls the network for inference against the testset. It then produces an F1 score and prints it.

==================================

3. F1 SCORE

The F1 score is calculated manually, since PyTorch has no built-in function to produce F1 scores.

To reproduce the F1 score, initialize a network and optimizer, then call test() to load and test an existing model from "model.pt".
